 Detailed Description:
 Basic stop watch using the Atmel 8-bit ATmega328P micro-controller and a common 
 anode 7-segment 4-digit LED panel.  Hardware is from SparkFun Clockit KIT-10930 
 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10930). The timebase is set by an external
 16MHz crystal oscillator.  Three push buttons (UP/DOWN/SNOOZE) and one switch 
 (ALARM ON/OFF) control operations.  Elaped time is indicated in seconds using
 a floating decimal point which moves to the right as the time increases. For 
 0.000 - 9.999 seconds 1/1000 of seconds are shown.  For 10.00 to 99.99 seconds
 hundredths are shown etc.  A piezo-electric buzzer is not used. The stopwatch
 operates in three modes RESET, RUN, STOP.  In RESET mode the elapsed time is 
 0.000s and the counter is not running. RESET is entered by pressing  SNOOZE 
 during STOP or RUN mode.  RUN is entered by pressing UP during RESET.  In RUN 
 mode the counter is counting and the elapsed time is displayed. In STOP mode
 the counter is not running and the elapsed time is displayed.  STOP is entered 
 by pressing DOWN during RUN mode.  In STOP mode holding UP and pressing DOWN 
 will restart the timer and change from STOP to RUN mode.  To change the 
 display brightness press SNOOZE during RESET mode.  The display will get
 brighter if the Alarm switch is ON and dimmer if the Alarm switch is OFF.

 Theory of Operation: (See stopwatch.c)
